# STW Bot
STW Bot is a Discord companion bot that allows you to remotely access your Epic Games account as well as your Fortnite: Save The World profile.

How to use the bot:
- Follow this [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1083374667982704710&permissions=67387392&scope=bot) and add the bot to one of your servers.
- Run the `/account login` command and follow the instructions on screen to log in.
- The bot requires an "Auth Code" to be submitted. This is then automatically exchanged for an Auth session, which the bot will use to access your account on your behalf.
- Once you've logged in, you'll have access to all commands and features!
- You can use the `/account logout` command at any time if you no longer wish for the bot to have access to your account. Your Auth session will immediately be terminated to keep your account secure.
